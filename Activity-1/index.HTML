       <h1>Ragdoll Cats</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>"The <strong>Ragdoll</strong> is a breed of cat with a distinct color-point coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty,
            and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s.
            They are best known for their <em>docile</em>, <em>placid temperament</em> and <em>affectionate</em> nature. The name Ragdoll is derived from 
            the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.
            The breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States,and is recognized by <abbr title="The International Cat Association">TICA</abbr>."
